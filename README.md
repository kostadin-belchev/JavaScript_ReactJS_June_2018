<b>JavaScript Web Module</b>
<p>
  JavaScript is unique in that it allows for the application of one programming language and the same tools for back-end and front-end elements of an application. In the JavaScript Web module, you will get acquainted with the development of server applications with Node.js and Express.js, as well as two of the most popular technologies for displaying the client part - ReactJS and Angular 2. The module will also pay attention to architecture and structuring of Single Page Applications and retrieving data from REST service through queries.
</p>

JavaScript Web Module consists of the following courses:

<b>ExpressJS Fundamentals course</b>
<p>
  The course is intense and aims to introduce students to the development of server JavaScript applications on the Node.js platform using Express.js as a framework. During the training we will learn how to create a server with Node.js, learn server-client architecture and how to make easy and fast data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB using modern techniques and tools.
</p>
<b>SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN</b>
<ul>
  <li>What is a Web Server</li>
  <li>Basic knowledge of HTTP protocol</li>
  <li>Server applications with Node.JS</li>
  <li>Working with non-relational databases</li>
  <li>MVC architecture</li>
  <li>Create applications entirely with JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<b>ReactJS Fundamentals</b>
<p>
  The training provides knowledge and practical skills for building Single Page Applications (SPA) with React JS technology - one of the most popular and fast client interface display libraries developed and maintained by Facebook and Instagram. We'll understand what SPA is, architectural templates for SPA applications, components, and routing.

We will pay special attention to the JSX syntax, preparing the application for publishing with WebPack, working with queries, Promises, advanced data management and status management through the Redux library. Ways to structure the code will be demonstrated and we will go through the thought process of working with React.
</p>
<b>SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN</b>
<ul>
  <li>What is a Single Page Application</li>
  <li>Working with remote REST services</li>
  <li>Basic knowledge of React and JSX</li>
  <li>Component-based applications</li>
  <li>Client applications with React</li>
  <li>Redux connection</li>
</ul>

<b>Angular Fundamentals</b>
<p>
  The Angular Fundamentals course provides knowledge and practical skills for building Single Application Applications with Angular 2 technology, a working framework of Google's making and one of the most popular at the moment. We will learn TypeScript, basic syntax and concepts and what more it offers to us in comparison with plain JavaScript, such as browser development improvements and mobile platforms.
We will learn about Single Page Application (SPA), architectural templates for SPA applications, components, directives, and their realization in Angular. Studying views and templates, models, components, data binding, multi-view, observables, routing, REST data retrieval, and dependency injection (DI).
